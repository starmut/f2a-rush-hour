# Changes

## Klotski

We added support for the Klotski game, by supporting two new characters in the
parsing format: "." and "S" for a 1x1 and 2x2 movable tile respectively.
These can move 1 cell in all 4 cardinal directions.
To this end, we abstracted out the `AGameWorld` class containing base functionality
for both Rush Hour and Klotski.

## Move class

The move class simply represents a piece that's being moved in a certain Posn.
These may not always be valid, so the `perform()`` method returns a boolean if the
_piece_ accepted the move (it was allowed in its move set).
A move can still be invalid since it could result in pieces overlapping, so that
needed to be checked separately.
This class also provides a way to invert the move, by returning a new object that
will un-perform it.

## Renaming classes to be less Rush Hour-centric

The classes used to be named "game piece", "vehicle", and so on, which reflected
well in the Rush Hour game, but not as much in the case of Klotski, since the
vehicle and parking lot analogy doesn't apply.
We renamed these classes to be based on "tile"s.

## Scoring and Undo

We added the mechanism to keep score, and undo previous moves - the user-facing
mechanics of this are specified in the user guide.
The previous moves were stored as a stack (Deque) to make it easier to pop off
the top move and perform the inverse move.
