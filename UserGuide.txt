## Running the game

To run Rush Hour, simply run the `ExamplesRushHourWorld` class using the tester library.
The java command should look something like:
```
java -classpath out/production/hw7-rush-hour:/path/to/javalib.jar:/path/to/tester.jar \
     tester.Main ExamplesRushHourWorld
```

## Playing the game

The target piece is red. You can click to select a piece, and it will become yellow.
Selected pieces can be moved by pressing the arrow keys, or WASD.

Pieces move along the direction in which they are longest.
If a piece cannot move in the direction you specified, it will not move.

The goal is to get the red piece to the exit, which is drawn in grey.
