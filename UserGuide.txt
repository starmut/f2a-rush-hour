## Running the game

The game now has two variants: Rush Hour, and Klotski.

To run Rush Hour, simply run the `ExamplesRushHourWorld` class using the tester library.
The java command should look something like:

To run Klotski, run the `ExamplesKlotskiWorld` class instead.

```
java -classpath out/production/hw7-rush-hour:/path/to/javalib.jar:/path/to/tester.jar \
     tester.Main <ExamplesRushHourWorld | ExamplesKlotskiWorld>
```

## Playing the game

### Mechanics

The target tile is red. You can click to select a tile, and it will become yellow.
Selected tile can be moved by pressing the arrow keys, or WASD.
If moving a tile causes it to overlap with another tile, that move will not occur.

The goal is to get the red tile to the exit, which is drawn in grey.

You can undo moves as well, and keep undoing until you enter the starting state again.
If your undo starts moving a different tile, that counts as a separate move, which will
still increase your score.

#### Rush Hour

Tiles move in the direction in which they are longest.
If a tile is square, it can move in all four directions.
If a tile cannot move in the direction you specify, it will not move.

#### Klotski

Tiles can move in all four cardinal directions.

### Scoring

A move is defined as a change in position of a tile, from start to finish.
If you move a single tile multiple times, it still counts as one single move.
If you move a different tile, it starts a new move.

Each new move increases your score by 1.
